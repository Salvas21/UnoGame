# Uno Game
## Concept
I made this game using a custom engine that my [teacher](https://github.com/dadajuice) made in Java. As a change color card, your goal is to defeat, by throwing normal numbers cards, all of the +4 cards and destroy the leader of the +4s. There is a little puzzle to be able to advance to the end section, a secret throwing cards upgrade and an easter egg about a game from another student of my class.
